Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning marathon run by students at the University of Warwick, UK. Now in its seventh year, it's the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK. Our next event is WASD {{ event_year }}, which will take place on {{ event_date_range }}.

The event raises money for SpecialEffect, a charity which develops and provides assistive technology to help people with disabilities to play games.
